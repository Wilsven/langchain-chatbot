IRAS first introduced PayNow as an option for businesses to receive Wage Credit Scheme[1] (WCS) payouts in March, resulting in a 20 per cent reduction in cheque volumes to-date.

To bring Singapore’s digital agenda to fruition, it is critical to encourage SMEs to get on board the digital payments train as they represent 99 per cent of businesses locally.

Currently, most taxpayers tend to pay for conveyancing stamp duty[2] via cheques and have to wait several days for the cheque to be cleared before a stamp duty certificate is issued. However, with DBS’ Direct Debit Authorisation (DDA) API, taxpayers can set up a GIRO account online, and make payment for their stamp duty and receive a stamp certificate through IRAS’ e-Stamping Portal instantly. In addition, with a transfer limit of SGD200,000 per transaction, the DBS DDA solution also enables IRAS to digitalise payments for the majority of conveyancing stamp duty transactions.
