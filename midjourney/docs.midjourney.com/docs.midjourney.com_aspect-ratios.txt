Aspect Ratios

The --aspect or --ar parameter changes the aspect ratio of the generated image. An aspect ratio is the width-to-height ratio of an image. It is typically expressed as two numbers separated by a colon, such as 7:4 or 4:3.
A square image has equal width and height, described as a 1:1 aspect ratio. The image could be 1000px × 1000px, or 1500px × 1500px, and the aspect ratio would still be 1:1. A computer screen might have a ratio of 16:10.  The width is 1.6 times longer than the height. So the image could be 1600px × 1000px, 4000px × 2000px, 320px x 200px, etc.


The default aspect ratio is 1:1.
--aspect must use whole numbers. Use 139:100 instead of 1.39:1.
The aspect ratio impacts the shape and composition of a generated image.
Some aspect ratios may be slightly changed when upscaling.


Max Aspect Ratios
Different Midjourney Version Models have different maximum aspect ratios.

Ratios
any*
1:2 to 2:1
Only: 1:1, 2:3 or 3:2
5:2 to2:5
3:2 to 2:3
1:2 to 2:1



The --ar parameter will accept any aspect ratio from 1:1 (square) up to the maximum aspect ratio for each model. However,  final outputs may be slightly modified during image generation or upscaling. Example: prompts using --ar 16:9 (1.78) create images with a 7:4 (1.75) aspect ratio.
*  Aspect ratios greater than 2:1 are experimental and may produce unpredicatble results.


prompt example: imagine/ prompt vibrant california poppies --ar 5:4

Common Midjourney Aspect Ratios
--aspect 1:1 Default aspect ratio.
--aspect 5:4 Common frame and print ratio.
--aspect 3:2 Common in print photography.
--aspect 7:4 Close to HD TV screens and smartphone screens.

How to Change the Aspect Ratio
Use Aspect Ratio Parameters
Add --aspect <value>:<value>, or --ar <value>:<value> to the end of your prompt.
