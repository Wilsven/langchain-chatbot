The /imagine command produces a grid of low-resolution image options based on your prompt. Use the buttons under each image grid to create variations of an image, upscale an image, or rerun the last Midjourney Bot action.





Upscale Buttons

U buttons upscale an image generating a larger version of the selected image and adding more details.
Redo
 🔄 The redo (re-roll) button reruns a job. In this case, it would rerun the original prompt producing a new grid of images.
