Permutation Prompts allow you to quickly generate variations of a Prompt with a single /imagine command. By including lists of options separated with commas , within curly braces {} in your prompt, you can create multiple versions of a prompt with different combinations of those options.


You can use Permutation Prompts to create combinations and permutations involving any part of a Midjourney Prompt, including text, image prompts, parameters, or prompt weights.
Permutation prompts are only available for Pro Subscribers using Fast mode.


Permutation Prompt Basics
Separate your list of options within curly brackets {} to quickly create and process multiple prompt variations.

Prompt Example:
/imagine prompt a {red, green, yellow} bird creates and processes three Jobs.
/imagine prompt a red bird
/imagine prompt a green bird
/imagine prompt a yellow bird


GPU Minutes

The Midjourney Bot processes each Permutation Prompt variation as an individual Job, each Job consumes GPU minutes.
Combo Prompts that create more than five Jobs will show a confirmation message before they begin processing.



Permutation Prompt Examples
Prompt Text Variations
The prompt /imagine prompt a naturalist illustration of a {pineapple, blueberry, rambutan, banana} bird will create and process four Jobs:



a naturalist illustration of a pineapple bird



a naturalist illustration of a blueberry bird





a naturalist illustration of a rambutan bird



a naturalist illustration of a banana bird




Prompt Parameter Variations
The prompt /imagine prompt a naturalist illustration of a fruit salad bird --ar {3:2, 1:1, 2:3, 1:2} will create and process four Jobs with different aspect ratios:



a naturalist illustration of a fruit salad bird --ar 3:2



a naturalist illustration of a fruit salad bird --ar 1:1



a naturalist illustration of a fruit salad bird --ar 2:3



a naturalist illustration of a fruit salad bird --ar 1:2



The prompt /imagine prompt a naturalist illustration of a fruit salad bird --{v 5, niji, test} will create and process three Jobs using different Midjourney Model Versions:



a naturalist illustration of a fruit salad bird --v 5



a naturalist illustration of a fruit salad bird --niji



a naturalist illustration of a fruit salad bird --test




Multiple and Nested Permutations
It is possible to use multiple sets of bracketed options in a single prompt.
/imagine prompt a {red, green} bird in the {jungle, desert} creates and processes four Jobs.
/imagine prompt a red bird in the jungle
/imagine prompt a red bird in the desert
/imagine prompt a green bird in the jungle
/imagine prompt a green bird in the desert

It is also possible to nest sets of bracketed options inside other sets of brackets within a single prompt:
Example: /imagine prompt A {sculpture, painting} of a {seagull {on a pier, on a beach}, poodle {on a sofa, in a truck}}.
/imagine prompt A sculpture of a seagull on a pier.
/imagine prompt A sculpture of a seagull on a beach.
/imagine prompt A sculpture of a poodle on a sofa.
/imagine prompt A sculpture of a poodle in a truck.
/imagine prompt A painting of a seagull on a pier.
/imagine prompt A painting of a seagull on a beach.
/imagine prompt A painting of a poodle on a sofa.
/imagine prompt A painting of a poodle in a truck.


Escape Character
If you want to include a , within the curly brackets that does not act as a separator place a backslash \ directly before it.
imagine prompt {red, pastel, yellow} bird produces three Jobs
/imagine prompt a red bird
/imagine prompt a pastel bird
/imagine prompt a yellow bird
imagine prompt {red, pastel \, yellow} bird produces two Jobs
/imagine prompt a red bird
/imagine prompt a pastel, yellow bird


A maximum of 40 Jobs can be created with a single Permutation Prompt.

A Prompt is a short text phrase that the Midjourney Bot interprets to produce an image. The Midjourney Bot breaks down the words and phrases in a prompt into smaller pieces, called tokens, that can be compared to its training data and then used to generate an image. A well-crafted prompt can help make unique and exciting images.There are two modes for image generation, Fast Mode and Relax Mode. Fast Mode tries to give you a GPU instantly. It's the highest-priority processing tier and uses your subscription's monthly GPU time. Relax Mode queues your generation behind others based on how much you've used the system. Relax Mode wait times are variable and usually range from 1–10 minutes.By default, your images will be generated using Fast mode. You can switch to Relax if you have a Standard or Pro subscription.A Job is any action that uses the Midjourney Bot. Jobs include using /imagine to create an initial image grid, upscaling images, and creating variations of images.
The Midjourney Bot processes jobs on high-end GPUs. Each minute that it takes to complete a job is a GPU minute. You have a limited amount of GPU minutes when in Fast Mode. Because image generations may be processed on multiple GPUs simultaneously, GPU minutes are not directly connected to the time you wait for an image to generate.
