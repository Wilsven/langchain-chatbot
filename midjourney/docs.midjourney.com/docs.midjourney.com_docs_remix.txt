Use Remix Mode to change prompts, parameters, model versions, or aspect ratios between variations. Remix will take the general composition of your starting image and use it as part of the new Job. Remixing can help change the setting or lighting of an image, evolve a subject, or achieve tricky compositions.


Remix is an experimental feature that may change or be removed at any time.


Using Remix
Activate Remix mode with the  /prefer remix command or by using the /settings command and toggling the 🎛️ Remix Mode button. Remix changes the behavior of the variation buttons (V1, V2, V3, V4) under image grids. When Remix is enabled, it allows you to edit your prompt during each variation. To Remix an upscale select 🪄 Make Variations.


When Remix is enabled, Variation buttons turn green when used instead of blue.
You can switch Model Versions when using Remix.
When you are done with Remix use the /settings or /prefer remix command to turn it off.
Create a standard image variation when Remix is active by not modifying the prompt in the pop-up window.

Starting Image

Model Change

line-art stack of pumpkins --test


Subject Change

balloon-animal shaped stack of pumpkins"


Medium Change

vibrant illustrated stack of fruit



Using Parameters with Remix
You can add or remove Parameters while using Remix mode, but you must use valid parameter combinations. Changing /imagine prompt illustrated stack of pumpkins --version 3 --stylize 10000 to illustrated stack of pumpkins --version 4 --stylize 10000 will return an error because Midjourney Model Version 4 is incompatible with the Stylize parameter.
Only parameters that normally influence variations will work while using Remix:

Changing aspect ratios with Remix will stretch an image. It will not extend the canvas, add missing details, or fix a bad crop.
