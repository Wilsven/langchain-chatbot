Midjourney routinely releases new model versions to improve efficiency, coherency, and quality. The latest model is the default, but other models can be used by adding the --version or --v parameter or by using the /settings command and selecting a model version. Each model excels at producing different types of images.


--version accepts the values 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 5.1.
--version can be abbreviated --v
