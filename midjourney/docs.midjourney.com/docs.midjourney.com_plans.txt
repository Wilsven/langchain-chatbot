Monthly Renewal

Unused monthly Fast GPU time does not roll over.
Fast mode is automatically reactivated when the subscription renews.


Switch Plans
Upgrade or downgrade plans at any time. When upgrading, you may choose whether the upgrade should be effective immediately, or at the end of the current billing cycle. If you choose to upgrade immediately, you will be offered a prorated price based on the usage of the plan you are upgrading from. Downgrades are always effective at the end of the current billing cycle.


Proration?

Unused Fast GPU Time is credited towards your account when you choose to upgrade immediately. If a Basic subscriber upgrades immediately without using any GPU time, they receive a $10 credit towards their new plan. If a Standard subscriber upgrades after using 50% of their Fast GPU time, they recieve a $15 credit towards their new plan.


Cancellation
Go to https://www.midjourney.com/account/ to cancel a subscription at any time. Cancellations are effective at the end of the current billing cycle. Subscription benefits like access to the community gallery are available until the end of the current billing cycle.



Generated images are not deleted when a user cancels their subscription. Resubscribe to a plan at any time by visiting https://www.midjourney.com/account/.


Refunds
Refunds are available for subscribers who have used less than 1% of their monthly GPU minutes, including time used in Relax Mode. If you are eligible for a refund, the dialog box will automatically pop up when you click to cancel your account.


Buy More Fast Hours
Run out of Fast GPU and want to buy more before your monthly subscription renews? You can purchase additional Fast GPU hours for $4/hr. Hourly Prices are experimental and subject to change.
Purchase more Fast GPU hours on your Midjourney account page.


Purchased Fast GPU hours do not expire, but you must have an active subscription to use them.


Account Information
Use the /info command to view information about your account, including how much Fast time is left for the subscription period, lifetime usage stats, the number of queued or running jobs, and the subscription renewal date.

There are two modes for image generation, Fast Mode and Relax Mode. Fast Mode tries to give you a GPU instantly. It's the highest-priority processing tier and uses your subscription's monthly GPU time. Relax Mode queues your generation behind others based on how much you've used the system. Relax Mode wait times are variable and usually range from 1–10 minutes.By default, images are generated using Fast Mode. You can switch to Relax if you have a Standard or Pro subscription.
