The --quality or --q parameter changes how much time is spent generating an image. Higher-quality settings take longer to process and produce more details. Higher values also mean more GPU minutes are used per job. The quality setting does not impact resolution.


The default --quality value is 1. Higher values use more of your subscription's GPU minutes.
--quality accepts the values: .25, .5, and 1 for the default model. Larger values will be rounded down to 1.
--quality only influences the initial image generation.
--quality works with Model Versions 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and niji.


Quality Settings
Higher --quality settings aren't always better. Sometimes a lower --quality settings can produce better resultsâ€”depending on the image you're trying to create. Lower --quality settings might be best for a gestural abstract look. Higher --quality values may improve the look of architectural images that benefit from many details. Choose the setting that best matches the kind of image you're hoping to create.

The Midjourney Bot processes jobs on high-end GPUs. Each minute that it takes to complete a job is a GPU minute. You have a limited amount of GPU minutes when in Fast Mode. Because image generations may be processed on multiple GPUs simultaneously, GPU minutes are not directly connected to the time you wait for an image to generate.
