2: Find a Newbies Channel

On Other Servers
You can generate images with the Midjourney Bot on any server that has invited the Bot. Look for instructions on your server on where to use the Bot.



3: Use the /imagine Command
About Discord Commands
Interact with the Midjourney Bot on Discord using a {{glossary.Command}}. Commands are used to create images, change default settings, monitor user info, and perform other helpful tasks.

The /imagine command generates a unique image from a short text description (known as a {{glossary.Prompt}}).


Using /imagine

Type /imagine prompt: or select the /imagine command from the slash commands pop-up.
Type a description of the image you want to create in the `prompt` field. 
Click return to send your message. 
The Midjourney Bot will generate a pop-up asking you to accept the Terms of Service. You must agree to the Terms of Service before any image will be generated.

Respect the Community Guidelines. Community guidelines apply wherever the Midjourney Bot is used.




If you don't see a pop-up when typing the /imagine command, try logging out, updating the Discord app, and logging back in.
Commands only work in bot Channels. Commands will not work in regular channels like #trial-support.


:::(Info) Prompting Tip!
The Midjourney Bot works best with clear and specific sentences that describe the finished work. It does not work well with conversational style lists of requests. Rather than providing specific instructions, such as 'Show me a picture of lots of blooming California poppies, make them bright, vibrant orange, and draw them in an illustrated style with colored pencils,' try describing what you want in a more straightforward manner, such as 'Vibrant orange California poppies illustrated with colored pencils.

4: Processes the Job
The Midjourney Bot takes about a minute to generate four options.




Generating an image activates the free Midjourney trial.Trial users can make roughly 25 Jobs before needing to subscribe.
A Job is any action that uses the Midjourney Bot. Jobs include using the /imagine command to create a grid of images, upscaling images, or creating image variations, all use your free trial time.
Use the /info command to check your Fast Time Remaining to see your remaining Trial time.



5: Upscale or Create Variations
After the initial image grid has finished generating, two rows of buttons appear:







U1
U2
U3
U4

U buttons upscale an image generating a larger version of the selected image and adding more details.

V1
V2
V3
V4

V buttons create slight variations of the selected grid image. Creating a variation generates a new image grid similar to the chosen image's overall style and composition.

🔄

The 🔄 (re-roll) reruns a Job. In this case it would rerun the original prompt producing a new grid of images. 




6: Rate Images
After using upscaling an image a new set of options will appear:





🪄 Make Variations 🔍 Light Upscale Redo
🔍 Beta Upscale Redo
↗️Web

Make Variations: creates a variation of the upscaled image and generates a new grid of four options.
Beta/Light Upscale Redo: redo the upscale using a different upscaler model.
Web:  Open the image in your gallery on Midjourney.com
