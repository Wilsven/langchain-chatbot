The --repeat or --r parameter runs a Job multiple times. Combine --repeat with other parameters, like --chaos to increase the pace of your visual exploration.


--repeat is available for Standard and Pro subscribers
--repeat accepts values 2â€“10 for Standard subscribers.
--repeat accepts values 2â€“40 for Pro subscribers.
The --repeat parameter can only be used in Fast GPU mode.
Using the redo (re-roll) ðŸ”„  button on the results of a --repeat Job will only re-run the prompt once.



A Job is any action that uses the Midjourney Bot. JobsÂ include using /imagine to create an initial image grid, upscaling images, and creating variations of images.
There are two modes for image generation, Fast Mode andÂ Relax Mode. Fast Mode tries to give you a GPU instantly. It's the highest-priority processing tier and uses your subscription's monthly GPU time. Relax Mode queues your generation behind others based on how much you've used the system. Relax Mode wait times are variable and usually range from 1â€“10 minutes.By default, your images will be generated using Fast mode. You can switch to RelaxÂ if you have a Standard or Pro subscription.
