Use the --stop parameter to finish a Job partway through the process. Stopping a Job at an earlier percentage can create blurrier, less detailed results.


--stop accepts values: 10â€“100.
The default --stop value is 100.
--stop does not work while Upscaling.

Stops affect on Upscaling
The --stop parameter does not affect a Job while upscaling. However, stopping will produce a softer, less detailed initial image that will influence the level of detail in the final upscaled result. The upscaled images below used the Beta Upscaler.

--stop 80



--stop 90



--stop 100
