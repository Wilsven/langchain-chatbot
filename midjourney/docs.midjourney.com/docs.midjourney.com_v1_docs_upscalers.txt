Midjourney starts by generating a grid of low-resolution image options for each Job. You can use a Midjourney upscaler on any grid image to increase the size and add additional details. There are multiple upscale models available for upscaling an image.
The U1 U2 U3 U4 buttons under each image grid are used to upscale the selected image.
Midjourney Dimensions and Sizes

* = the default upscaler for each Midjourney Version Model.
** Max Upscale is an older resource-intensive upscaler and is only available when users are in Fast Mode.


Midjourney Model 5

The newest Midjourney Model Version 5 (and Niji 5) produces high-resolution 1024 x1024 px image grids without needing an additional step to upscale each image. When using Midjourney Model Version 5, the U1 U2 U3 U4 buttons under each image grid will separate the selected image from the initial image grid.


Regular (Default) Upscaler
The latest default upscaler increases image size while smoothing or refining details. Some small elements may change between the initial grid image and the finished upscale.

Light Upscaler
The Light Upscaler creates a 1024px x 1024px image and adds a moderate amount of details and textures. The Light Uspscaler is useful for faces and smooth surfaces when using older Midjourney Model Versions.
Use the --uplight parameter to change the behavior of the U1 U2 U3 U4 upscale buttons to use the Light Upscaler.

Detailed Upscaler
The Detail Upscaler, creates a 1024px x 1024px image and adds many additional fine details to the image.
Images that have been upscaled with the detailed upscaler can be upscaled again using the Upscale to Max button for a final resolution of 1664px x 1664px. Upscale to Max is only available when in Fast mode.
The Detailed upscaler is the default for Midjourney Model Versions V1, V2, V3, and hd

Beta Upscaler
The Beta Upscaler creates a 2048px x 2048px image without adding many additional details. The Beta Uspcaler is useful for faces and smooth surfaces.
Use the --upbeta parameter to change the behavior of the U1 U2 U3 U4 upscale buttons to use the Beta Upscaler.

Remaster
Remaster is an additional option for previously upscaled images made with the V1, V2, or V3 Model Versions. Remaster will upscale an image again using the --test and --creative parameters blending the composition of the original image and the coherency of the newer --test model.
Remaster any previously upscaled job by clicking the üÜï  Remaster button found beneth the original upscale.
To Remaster very old jobs, use the /show command to refresh that job in Discord.

Remaster Notes


Only works on Aspect Ratio up to 2:3 or 3:2
Inconsistent results with Multi Prompts
Does not work with Image Prompts.



How to Switch Upscalers
Use the Settings Command

‚è´ Regular Upscale
‚¨ÜÔ∏è Light Upscale
üî• Beta Upscale

Type /settings and select your preferred upscaler from the menu.
Use an Upscaler Parameter
Add --uplight, or --upbeta to the end of your prompt.
Use an Upscale Redo Button

‚è´ Regular Upscale
‚¨ÜÔ∏è Light Upscale
üî• Beta Upscale

After you upscale an image you will see a row of buttons underneath the image that let you redo the upscale using a different upscaler model.

There are two modes for image generation, Fast Mode and¬†Relax Mode. Fast Mode tries to give you a GPU instantly. It's the highest-priority processing tier and uses your subscription's monthly GPU time. Relax Mode queues your generation behind others based on how much you've used the system. Relax Mode wait times are variable and usually range from 1‚Äì10 minutes.By default, your images will be generated using Fast mode. You can switch to Relax¬†if you have a Standard or Pro subscription.
